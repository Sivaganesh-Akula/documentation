# Staging
The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about
what will go into your next commit. Its technical name in Git parlance is the “index”, but the phrase
“staging area” works just as well.

Commands for staging

- `git add --all`s- `git add -A`
- `git add .`
- `git add filename/filepath`
